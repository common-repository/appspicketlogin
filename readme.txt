Two Factor Authentication for your Wordpress installation. No friction of  SMS codes, tokens or mobile apps

== Description ==
Protect your Wordpress installation with AppsPicket Two Factor Authentication. Our one-step, Two Factor Authentication (2FA) checks both the user password and the user device each time the user logs in, **without the need to input additional codes, tokens or mobile app installation**.

Your Wordpress site is protected from hackers even if your user's passwords are leaked via third-party sites or otherwise. Our frictionless 2FA protects all your users.

The plugin also provides a user registration screen which requires an additional pass-code check by the user. The code is sent over email and mobile (if provided).

Protect your Wordpress installation without causing any friction to your users with our **One-step, Two Factor Authentication**.
